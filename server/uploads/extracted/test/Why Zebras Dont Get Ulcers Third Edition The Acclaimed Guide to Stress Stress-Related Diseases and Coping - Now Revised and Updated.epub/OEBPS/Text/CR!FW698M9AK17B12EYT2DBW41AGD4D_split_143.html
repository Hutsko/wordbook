Friedman, who was somewhat of a father figure to me, passed away recently at age ninety-one. He was a man who, statistically, had so little time left, yet he had somehow beaten that ticking toxic clock, and he had all the time in the world. But he hadn’t turned into a contentless geezer—up until his last days, he was seeing patients, running an institute at UCSF Medical Center, cranky about delays in his work, anticipating his next data, arguing with competitors with a different take on the subject. Full of appetites, but with an appetite being its own reward and no rancor at the idea that it might not be fulfilled. And deeply engaged with the idea that the world would be a more decent place if something was done about those Type-A people—Friedman was one of the two people I described a few paragraphs back (along with his medical director, Bart Sparagon) who said he was in the business of ethics. Friedman would do something very interesting and confessional with this. He was a gentle, courtly man who had been a driven, steamrolling son of a bitch before a heart attack in his fifties. He’d stand up in front of a group of his patients, ruthless CEO Type-A barracudas with their first heart attacks at age forty-two, and say, “Look at me—not look at me, I used to be so Type A that I developed a bad heart, but look at me, I used to be so Type A that I was a bad person,” and then he’d prove it—tales of people he was curt to, whose efforts he never noticed, whose accomplishments he envied. And here he was at age ninety, metaphorically the ex-alcoholic preacher who has been there. Cardiology as redemption. It would be hard to make a choice between making the world a healthier place or a kinder place. Here was a man who did both. I miss him.</span></p>
