Instead of having to use one of these fancy electronic cuffs that seems likely to electrocute you during the night, and thus constitutes a stressor on its own, here’s what you do. Take a string of (I don’t specify how many) postage stamps. Wrap it around the guy’s penis, moisten the last one, tape it to the others, forming a postage stamp ring. The next morning, check: if the stamps have been pulled loose on one side or torn, the guy had a REM-stage erection during the night—fabulous, a lab result for a couple of bucks. The insurance people will hassle you about reimbursement for it, though.</span></p>
