This is helpful, because prior to modern imaging techniques, surgeons often had to have the patient awake to guide what they were doing. Place an electrode in the brain, stimulate, the patient flops her arm. Go a little deeper with the electrode, stimulate, and the patient flops her leg. Quick, consult your brain road map, figure out where you are, go an inch deeper, hang a left past the third neuron, and thereâ€™s the tumor. That sort of thing.</span></p>
