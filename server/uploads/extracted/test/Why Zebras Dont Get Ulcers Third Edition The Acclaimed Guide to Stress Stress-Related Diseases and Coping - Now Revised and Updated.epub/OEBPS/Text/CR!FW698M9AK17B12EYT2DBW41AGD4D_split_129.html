It also showed that stress and glucocorticoids are the strongest inhibitors of such neurogenesis. The finding also noted that it is not clear yet what these new neurons are good for, although it wouldn’t be crazy to think that new neurons in the hippocampus might have something good to do for memory. Thus, it doesn’t seem crazy, either, to speculate that an inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus before and during depression might contribute to the memory problems that have been reviewed. This seems plausible to me. But there is also the additional idea floating around in the field that the inhibition of neurogenesis gives rise to the <span><span class="italic">emotional</span></span> symptoms as well (that is to say, the anhedonia and grief that define a depression), and that antidepressants work by jump-starting hippocampal neurogenesis. This theory has garnered a lot of attention, and there have been some highly visible studies supporting it. Nonetheless, I don’t find those studies or the basic idea to be too convincing—I can come up with a route that links the functions of the hippocampus to the emotional features of a depression, but it feels way too convoluted to be at the core of what causes this disease. (You’ll note that I bury this in a footnote, in the hope that some colleagues whom I like and respect on the other side of this question won’t come and stab me.)</span></p>
