The authors did a superb job of ruling out various confounding factors. They showed that this increased risk didn’t occur in other urban areas in the country. It wasn’t due to self-selection (i.e., who but stressed, heart disease-prone crazies choose to live in NYC?). It was not a function of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or immigrant status. It was not due to people happening to be in NYC at the time of day when people get more heart attacks (i.e., commuters during work hours). It wasn’t due to New York doctors having a tendency to mislabel other maladies as heart attacks. Instead, it was most plausibly a function of stress, excitement, fear, and more disruption of sleep/wake cycles than in most other places. And this was before 9/11. Naturally, like all the other native New Yorkers I know, I find this paper to be perversely pleasing and affirming.</span></p>
