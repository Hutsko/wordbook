However, not all diseases are more prevalent among the poor, and, fascinatingly, some are even more common among the wealthy. Melanoma is an example, suggesting that sun exposure in a lounge chair may have different disease risks than getting your neck red from stooped physical labor (or that a huge percentage of poor people laboring away in the sun have a fair amount of melanin in their skin, if you know what I mean). Or multiple sclerosis, and a few other autoimmune diseases and, during its heyday, polio. Or “hospitalism,” a pediatric disease of the 1930s in which infants would waste away in hospitals. It is now understood that it was mostly due to lack of contact and sociality—and kids who would wind up in poorer hospitals were less subject to this, since the hospitals couldn’t afford state-of-the-art incubators, necessitating that staff actually hold them.</span></p>
