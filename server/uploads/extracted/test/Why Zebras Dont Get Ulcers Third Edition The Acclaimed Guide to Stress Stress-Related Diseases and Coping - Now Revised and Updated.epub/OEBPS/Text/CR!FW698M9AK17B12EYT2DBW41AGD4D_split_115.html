For the most part I’m without vices—I don’t smoke, have never had a drink or illicit drug in my life, don’t eat meat or drink tea or coffee. But I’m incredibly bad at getting enough sleep; I’ve needed a nap since the Carter administration. I’ve got this colleague, William Dement, who is considered the dean of sleep research, absolutely evangelical about the health risks of sleep deprivation, and on days when I’m really a mess from lack of sleep, I live in dread of running into him. So on this one, do as I say, not as I do.</span></p>
