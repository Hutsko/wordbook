Peter Sterling points out that if the body worked by classical homeostatic principles of low-level, local feedback control, adult-onset diabetes shouldn’t exist. It would be avoided with a simple regulatory issue—put on a certain amount of weight and fat cells tell appetite centers in the brain to stop being hungry. But it doesn’t work that way—as we collectively keep putting on more weight, we collectively keep getting hungrier. Sterling points out the allostatic fact that there is a lot more to regulating appetite than simply how much fat you have stored, and that all sorts of higher level factors, including numerous societal ones, tend to override the efforts of fat cells to decrease appetite. This will be returned to in chapter 16.</span></p>
