The question becomes which of the steps—brain, pituitary, adrenals—is the spot where there is a problem. There turn out to be a number of sites where things work differently in subordinate and dominant baboons. Interestingly, the mechanisms that give rise to the pattern in subordinate baboons are virtually identical with those that give rise to the elevated glucocorticoid levels that occur in many humans with major depression.</span></p>
