Given how much this section is, perhaps, reading like a critical dissection of this field, I think it is worth noting that I was a coauthor on this study. Weâ€™re still utterly puzzled as to why the loss of the daily rhythmic fluctuation in glucocorticoid levels predicted a bad outcome. A possibility is that the loss of the glucocorticoid rhythm is irrelevant, a red herring, and the key thing is that the daily rhythm of some other hormone, like melatonin, has been lost. This is something that is now being investigated.</span></p>
