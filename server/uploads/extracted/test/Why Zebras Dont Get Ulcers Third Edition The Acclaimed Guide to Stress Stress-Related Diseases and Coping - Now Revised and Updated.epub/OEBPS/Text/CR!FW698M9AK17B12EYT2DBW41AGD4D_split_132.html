Is there no alternative? Painfully, I think not. You can study cancer in a petri dish—grow a tumor and then see if some drug slows the tumor’s growth, and with what other toxicity; you can experiment with atherosclerotic plaque formation in a dish—grow blood-vessel cells and see if your drug removes cholesterol from their sides, and at what dosage. But you can’t mimic depression in a petri dish, or with a computer. Millions of us are going to succumb to this nightmarish disorder, the treatments are still not very good, and animal models remain the best methods for seeking improvement. If you are of the school that believes that animal research, while sad, is acceptable, your goal is to do only good science on the smallest number of animals with the least pain.</span></p>
