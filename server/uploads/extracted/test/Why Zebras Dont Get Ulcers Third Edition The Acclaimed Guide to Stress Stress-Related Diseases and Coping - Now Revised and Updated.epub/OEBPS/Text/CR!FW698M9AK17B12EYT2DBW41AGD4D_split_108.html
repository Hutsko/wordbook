In the previous section, we added your hippocampus to that list of places that are spoon-fed energy with the onset of a stressor. It seems like that would be a clever area to continue to stoke, as the stressor goes on. Why should glucose delivery eventually be inhibited there? Probably because, as time goes by, you are running more on automatic, relying more on the implicit memory outposts in the brain to do things that involve reflexive movement—the martial arts display you put on to disarm the terrorist or, at least, the coordinated swinging of the softball bat at the company picnic that you’ve been nervous about. And thus, the decreased glucose delivery to highfalutin brain regions like the hippocampus and cortex may be a means to divert energy to those more reflexive brain regions.</span></p>
