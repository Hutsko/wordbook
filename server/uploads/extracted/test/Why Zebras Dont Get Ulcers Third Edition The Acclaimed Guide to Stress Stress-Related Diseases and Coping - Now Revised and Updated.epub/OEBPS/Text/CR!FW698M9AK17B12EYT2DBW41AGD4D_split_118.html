There is some evidence that DHEA serves as an “anti-stress” hormone, blocking the actions of glucocorticoids, and that it can have some beneficial effects in aged populations. I’ve buried DHEA in this footnote, however, because the subject is quite controversial and in need of some more convincing studies, in my view.</span></p>
