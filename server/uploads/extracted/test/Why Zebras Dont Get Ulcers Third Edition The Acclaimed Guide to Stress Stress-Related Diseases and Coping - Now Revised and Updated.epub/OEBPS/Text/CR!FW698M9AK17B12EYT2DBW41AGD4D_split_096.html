Apparently quite an experience: all expenses covered plus a small salary, many recreational activities in the peaceful Salisbury countryside, daily blowing of noses into collection tubs for the staff, questionnaires to fill out, and being spritzed up the nose with either placebo or a cold-causing virus. One in three chance, on average, of getting a cold while there. People would compete for slots as volunteers; couples have met there, married, returned for honeymoons; folks with connections would maneuver for return visits, making it an annual paid vacation. (All was not idyllic sniffling heaven at the Cold Unit, however. An occasional group would be involved in studies showing that, for example, being chilled and damp does not cause colds, and would have to stand around for hours in wet socks.) Unfortunately, because of budget limitations, the unit has been closed. This paradise lost has been chronicled in at least one scholarly book, plus articles with titles like, “How I Blew My Summer Vacation.”</span></p>
