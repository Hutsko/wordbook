This can be operationally defined as how many times the other animal is willing to press a lever, for example, to gain access to the subject. <span><span class="italic">Receptivity</span></span> describes how readily the subject responds to the entreaties of the other animal. Among rats, this can be defined by the occurrence of the “lordosis” reflex, a receptive stance by the female in which she arches her back, making it easier for the male to mount. Female primates show a variety of receptive reflexes that facilitate male mounting, depending on the species. <span><span class="italic">Proceptivity</span></span> refers to how actively the subject pursues the other animal.</span></p>
