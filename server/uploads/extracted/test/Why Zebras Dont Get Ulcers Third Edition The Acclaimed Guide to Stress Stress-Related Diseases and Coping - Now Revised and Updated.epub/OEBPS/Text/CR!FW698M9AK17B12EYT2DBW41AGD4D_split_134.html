You have to find an anesthetic that does not distort the levels of hormones that you are measuring. You have to dart every animal at the same time of day to control for daily fluctuations in hormone levels. If you want to get a first blood sample in which hormone levels reflect basal, nonstressed conditions, you can’t dart someone who is sick or injured or who has had a fight or intercourse that day. For some of the cholesterol studies, I could not dart anyone who had eaten in the preceding twelve hours. If you are trying to measure resting hormone levels, you can’t spend all morning making the same animal nervous as you repeatedly try to dart him; instead you get one shot, and you can’t let him see it coming. Finally, once you dart him, you have to obtain the first blood sample rapidly, before hormone levels change in response to the dart. Quite a thing to do with your college education.<br class="calibre1" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are these studies exclusively about males? Because of the difficulties inherent in trying to dart and anesthetize females. At any given time in this baboon population, approximately 80 percent of the adult females are either pregnant or nursing their young. You don’t want to dart a female who is pregnant, as there is a good chance that the anesthesia will endanger the pregnancy. And you don’t want to dart a female who has a youngster holding on to her in a panic as she goes down, or spends a day badly endangered for lack of milk while Mom is anesthetized.</span></p>
