Among those proteins, fighting those microbes, is one we heard about in chapter 3 called “C-reactive protein.” You will recall how gunk like cholesterol forms atherosclerotic plaques only at places where your blood vessels are injured. Thus, a measure of injury and inflammation at your blood vessels is a good predictor of atherosclerotic risk. C-reactive protein, as we learned, is the most reliable indicator of such inflammation.</span></p>
