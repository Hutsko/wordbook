Or at least I thought I was. It was in the mid-1980s. The idea made some sense, and the lab I was in jumped on it under my prompting. We worked like maniacs, and at two o’clock one morning I had one of those moments of euphoria that scientists die for: looking at the printout from one of the machines and realizing, “Aha, I was right, it does work that way—interleukin-1 released CRH.” We wrote up the findings, they were accepted by the prestigious journal <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span>, everyone was very excited, I called my parents, and so on. Paper gets published, and right next to it was an <span><span class="italic">identical</span></span> study from a group in Switzerland, sent in to the journal the same exact week. So I became <span><span class="italic">a</span></span> discoverer of this obscure fact. (To hark back to a theme of chapter 2, if you are a mature, confident individual—which unfortunately I am only rarely—you take pleasure in this sort of thing: two labs, working independently on opposite sides of the globe, come up with the same novel observation. It must be true. Science lurches forward an inch.)</span></p>
