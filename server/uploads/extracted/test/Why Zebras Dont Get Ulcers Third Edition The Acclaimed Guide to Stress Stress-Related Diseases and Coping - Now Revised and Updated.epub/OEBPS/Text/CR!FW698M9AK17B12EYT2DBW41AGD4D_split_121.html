A local TV station was doing a piece on how stressful rush-hour traffic was, and I wound up giving them advice—turning this chapter into a 15-second sound bite. Somewhere along the way we stumbled onto the great idea of getting a certified Type-A individual (we eventually found one through a local Type-A cardiology clinic) who did the commute each day and measuring his stress hormone levels before and during a commute. The film crew would take some saliva samples from which glucocorticoid levels would be measured. Great. Get to the guy’s house just before his commute, collect some spit in a test tube. Then into traffic—with the film crew increasingly stressed by the worry that there wouldn’t be any tie-ups. But soon the snarls began, bumper to bumper. Then the second saliva sample was taken. Laboratory analysis, anxious TV producers awaiting results. Baseline sample at home: highly elevated glucocorticoid levels. Rush-hour level: <span><span class="italic">way down</span></span>. Oh no. I’m convinced that the explanation for the outcome of that unscientific experiment was the social support. For this guy, who Type-A’s his way through rush hour each day, this was fabulous. A chance to be on television, a bunch of people there with him to document what a stressful commute he endures, getting to feel he’s the chosen representative of all Type A’s, their anointed. He apparently spent the entire ride cheerfully pointing out how horrible it was, how much worse he’s seen (“You think this is bad?! This isn’t bad. You should have been in Troy in ’47.”). He had a fabulous time. The punch line? Everyone should have a friendly film crew in tow when they’re stuck in traffic.</span></p>
