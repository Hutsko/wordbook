Clinical lore supports this picture, as do some laboratory studies. However, there’s a problem here, which is that high-carb foods are typically easier to eat than low-carb foods, since the former tend to be snacks. So it’s not clear if people really get a craving for carbohydrates, or if they get a craving for easy, mindless eating.</span></p>
