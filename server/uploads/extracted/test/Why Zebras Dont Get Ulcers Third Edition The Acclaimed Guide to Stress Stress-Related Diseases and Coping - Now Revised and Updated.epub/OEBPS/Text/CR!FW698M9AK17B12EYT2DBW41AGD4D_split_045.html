By the rules of endocrinology, a putative hormone is referred to as a “factor” until its chemical structure is confirmed, at which point it graduates into being a “hormone.” CRF achieved that status in the mid-1980s, and my continued use of “CRF” as recently as the 1998 edition was merely a nostalgic and pathetic attempt on my part to hold on to those reckless days of my youth before CRF was tamed. After much painful psychological work, I have come to terms with this and will use “CRH” throughout.</span></p>
