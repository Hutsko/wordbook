According to the eminent stress physiologist Seymour Levine, this goes back to Galen, who believed that the brain was responsible for rational thought and the peripheral viscera for emotions. Seeing this collection of neural pathways linking the two suggested that it allowed your brain to sympathize with your viscera. Or maybe for your viscera to sympathize with your brain. As we’ll see shortly, the other half of the autonomic nervous system is called the parasympathetic nervous system. Para, meaning “alongside,” refers to the not very exciting fact that the parasympathetic neural projections sit alongside those of the sympathetic.</span></p>
