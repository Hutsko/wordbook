Schally and crew were the first to submit a paper for publication saying, in effect, “There really does exist a hormone in the brain that regulates thyroid hormone release, and its chemical structure is X.” In a photo finish, Guillemin’s team submitted a paper reaching the identical conclusion five weeks later. But as a complication, a number of months before, Guillemin and friends had been the first to publish a paper saying, in effect, “If you synthesize a chemical with structure X, it regulates thyroid hormone release and does so in a way similar to the way hypothalamic brain mash does; we don’t know yet if whatever it is in the hypothalamus also has structure X, but we wouldn’t be one bit surprised if it did.” So Guillemin was the first to say, “This structure works like the real thing,” and Schally was the first to say, “This structure is the real thing.” As I have discovered firsthand many decades afterward, the battle-scarred veterans of the Guillemin-Schally prizefight years are still willing to get worked up as to which counts as the knockout.<br class="calibre1" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might wonder why something obvious wasn’t done a few years into this insane competition, like the National Institutes of Health sitting the two down and saying, “Instead of us giving you all of this extra taxpayers’ money to work separately, why don’t you two work together?” Surprisingly, this wouldn’t necessarily be all that great for scientific progress. The competition served an important purpose. Independent replication of results is essential in science. Years into a chase, a scientist triumphs and publishes the structure of a new hormone or brain chemical. Two weeks later the other guy comes forward. He has <span><span class="italic">every</span></span> incentive on earth to prove that the first guy was wrong. Instead, he is forced to say, “I hate that son of a bitch, but I have to admit he’s right. We get the identical structure.” That is how you know that your evidence is really solid, from independent confirmation by a hostile competitor. When everyone works together, things usually do go faster, but everyone winds up sharing the same assumptions, leaving them vulnerable to small, unexamined mistakes that can grow into big ones.</span></p>
