    <p class="calibre23">A brief digression: what about those children who senesce incredibly rapidly and die of old age when they are twelve? Progeria, as the disease is called, is extremely rare. Those afflicted go bald, have bony chins, beaked noses, and dry, scratchy voices; they lose their hearing, get hardening of the arteries and heart disease (which is what usually kills them). When you try to grow some of their cells in a petri dish, you have as much trouble as you would with the cells of a seventy-year-old. Despite that, not everything about progeric kids is prematurely aged: they don’t become demented, nor do they get cancer—two diseases typically linked with aging (although not necessary features of it, obviously). General consensus in the field is that progeria is a disease of some facets of aging being accelerated, rather than the entire aging process (which indirectly demonstrates that aging involves the ticking of multiple and independent clocks in the body). For a discussion of progeria and its relationship to aging, see Finch, C., <span><span class="italic">Longevity, Senescence and the Genome</span></span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991); Mills, R., and Weiss, A., “Does progeria provide the best model of accelerated aging in humans?” <span><span class="italic">Gerontology</span></span> 36 (1990): 84.</p>

    <p class="calibre53">A brief tirade about ECT: few medical procedures of our time have a worse popular image. In the past, ECT involved sufficient amounts of electricity to cause brain damage and memory loss, and to induce convulsions, causing body injury. Far worse, ECT’s use for all sorts of things besides intractable depression—behavior disorders, juvenile delinquency, and so on—smacked of medicopolitical control and punishment. However, ECT is now conducted very differently—far less electricity is used, and there is no evidence that the modern form of ECT causes brain damage or permanent memory loss. Moreover, people are now typically sedated during ECT sessions, which virtually eliminates the danger of physical injury from convulsing. Most important, when it is administered correctly, ECT can save lives. For people who have been through every type of psychotherapy, every known antidepressant, and every combination of the two, yet are still suicidally depressed, ECT may be the only known technique that will ever get them functioning again. It can be an extraordinarily helpful procedure, and many former depressives swear by it.

For another general overview of the field, see Routtenberg, A., “The reward system of the brain,” <span><span class="italic">Scientific American</span></span> (November 1978). For a demonstration that stimulation of these pathways can be more reinforcing than food, see Routtenberg, A., and Lindy, J., “Effects of the availability of rewarding septal and hypothalamic stimulation on bar pressing for food under conditions of deprivation,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology</span></span> 60 (1965): 158. For an early study implicating norepinephrine in the pleasure pathway, see Stein, L., “Effects and interactions of imipramine, chlorpromzaine, reserpine, and amphetamine on self-stimulation: possible neurophysiological basis of depression,” in Wortis, J., ed., <span><span class="italic">Recent Advances in Biological Psychiatry</span></span>, vol. 4 (New York: Plenum, 1962), 288. This study showed that norepinephrine depletion in the rat decreases self-stimulation of the pleasure pathways. In recent years, there has been a shift in this field away from considering norepinephrine to be the principal neurotransmitter of the pleasure pathways, much as there has been a shift away from considering it the sole culprit in depression. A neurotransmitter called dopamine is moving toward the forefront as the first neurotransmitter among equals involved in pleasure signaling. This makes some sense, as cocaine works mostly on dopamine synapses. However, although norepinephrine is probably not the most important neurotransmitter of pleasure perception, a defect in norepinephrine regulation in that part of the brain still has a great deal of potential for wreaking havoc. In considering how multiple neurotransmitters are used in many synaptic steps in these pleasure pathways, an analogy might help: a long cable may be made of stronger and weaker materials at different points; nevertheless, severing the cable in any place causes problems, and the norepinephrine link might be where the severing occurs.

    <p class="calibre53">Issues of gender differences in control and in substance abuse in traditional societies. Loewenthal, K., Goldblatt, V., “Gender and depression in Anglo-Jewry,” <span><span class="italic">Psychological Medicine</span></span> 25 (1995): 1051. I found this study to be quite confusing, or at least challenging of my expectations. This paper initially seemed to test the idea that the gender difference was an artifact of men being more likely than women to mask their depression in alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse (i.e., the depressed alcoholic is more likely to get categorized as an alcoholic than as a depressive). Thus, the authors examined a population of Orthodox Jews, among whom rates of alcohol and drug abuse are exceedingly low. If in the general population, men have a depression rate of X and women 2X, one would expect the rates of depression in these Orthodox women and men to both be 2X (in other words, in the general population, men actually had 2X rates of depression, but half of those cases were categorized as substance abuse). The paper did indeed report equivalent rates of depression in women and in men among Orthodox Jews, in sharp contrast to the general population. However, rather than everyone having the 2X rate of the general population, everyone was more like X. Thus, it wasn’t the lack of alcoholism unmasking the higher rate of depression in men. Rather, it was something about Orthodoxy lowering the depression rate in women to the lower levels seen in men. The authors suggested that this was due to the honored and socially meaningful role of women in Orthodox Jewish society. As someone who was raised in such a community, I find myself to be a bit skeptical of this interpretation, but cannot offer a better one.</p>

    <p class="calibre53">Estrogen and progesterone have effects on the brain; as just some examples of these, estrogen will change the electrical excitability of the brain (Teyler, T., Vardaris, R., Lewis, D., and Rawitch, A., “Gonadal steroids: effects on excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 209 [1980]: 1017) and the number of receptors for some of the major neurotransmitters (Schumacher, M., “Rapid membrane effects of steroid hormones: an emerging concept in neuroendocrinology,” <span><span class="italic">Trends in Neurosciences</span></span> 13 [1990]: 359; see also Weiland, N., “Sex steroids alter N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding in the hippocampus,” <span><span class="italic">Society for Neuroscience Abstracts</span></span> 16 [1990]: 959), as well as the number of receiving sites on dendrites (“dendritic spines”) that form synapses with axon terminals. This last observation is particularly interesting, as it has been shown that the number of dendritic spines fluctuates in parts of the brain of the rat as a function of the reproductive cycle of the female (Woolley, C., Gould, E., Frankfurt, M., and McEwen, B., “Naturally occurring fluctuation in dendritic spine density on adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Neuroscience</span></span> 10 [1990]: 4035; Young, E., Korszun, A., “Psychoneuroendocrinology of depression: Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis,” <span><span class="italic">Psychiatric Clinics of North America</span></span> 21 [1999]: 309).</p>

    <p class="calibre23">Progesterone also has effects, in that one of its breakdown products (metabolites) can bind to one of the main neurotransmitter receptor types in the brain and alter its functioning: Majewska, M., Harrison, N., Schwartz, R., Barker, J., and Paul, S., “Steroid hormone metabolites are barbiturate-like modulators of the GABA receptor,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 232 (1986): 1004. This is particularly interesting for two reasons. First, the fact that the critical agent there is not progesterone but its metabolite (called 3-alpha-hydroxy-5-alpha-dihydroprogesterone by its close friends) means that one must keep track of not only how much progesterone there is on the scene but how much of it gets converted to the metabolite. Of particular interest in terms of the menstrual cycle, progesterone, mood, and depression is the fact that these progesterone metabolites bind to the same receptor complex that binds the benzodiazepine tranquilizers (like those marketed as Valium and Librium) as well as barbiturate anesthetics (“downers”). Moreover, at proper doses, this progesterone metabolite can work as an anesthetic itself (such “steroid anesthetics” have even been used on humans during surgery). No one has quite sorted out the functional significance of this yet, but everyone assumes that something extremely interesting is going on.</p>

    <p class="calibre53">Type A: the definitive prospective study showing a link between Type-A personality and coronary heart disease is Rosenman, R., Brand, R., Jenkins, C., Friedman, M., Straus, R., and Wurm, M., “Coronary heart disease in the Western Collaborative Group Study: final follow-up experience of 812 years,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association</span></span> 233 (1975): 872. See also Friedman, M., and Rosenman, R., <span><span class="italic">Type A Behavior and Your Heart</span></span> (New York: Knopf, 1974).

    <p class="calibre23">Problems with replicating the original Type-A finding: the most influential study was Shekelle, R., Billings, J., and Borhani, N., “The MRFIT behavior pattern study. II. Type-A behavior and incidence of coronary heart disease,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Epidemiology</span></span> 122 (1985): 599. Others are discussed in Barefoot, J., Peterson, B., Harrell, F., et al., “Type A behavior and survival: a follow-up study of 1,467 patients with coronary artery disease,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Cardiology</span></span> 64 (1989): 427.</p>

    <p class="calibre23">The demonstration that Type-A behavior is associated with better survivorship: the Barefoot study just cited, plus Ragland, D., and Brand, R., “Type A behavior and mortality from coronary heart disease,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 313 (1988): 65. That finding is a good lesson in how incredibly subtle some confounds can be in epidemiology research. Why should being Type A be associated with better survivorship, once you are diagnosed with coronary heart disease? Some possibilities: Type-A people, because of their driven and disciplined nature, are more likely to comply with the medicine, dieting, and exercise schedules given them by their doctors. Or certain people may immediately be recognized as being Type A by their doctors, who then think “Aha, here’s this Type-A patient with coronary heart disease. I know all about Friedman and Rosenman’s studies; I’d better take extra good care of this person.” Or Type-A people may be more disciplined about annual checkups with doctors, and thus be diagnosed with coronary heart disease earlier than average, when it is still pretty mild—leading to seemingly better survivorship. This last factor has probably been ruled out, but no one is sure about the other possible confounds yet, as the studies showing better Type-A survivorship are quite recent. Some of the possible sources of confounds in these findings are discussed in Matthews, K., and Haynes, S., “Type A behavior pattern and coronary disease risk,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Epidemiology</span></span> 123 (1986): 923.</p>

    <p class="calibre53">Footnote: A technical description of alopecia areata can be found in Rook, A., and Dawber, R., <span><span class="italic">Diseases of the Hair and Scalp</span></span>, 2d ed. (Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1991). In actuality, though, there is not really a change in hair color under those circumstances. Alopecia areata occurs in people who already have some degree of whitening or graying of their hair. With the onset of the trauma, hair that is not white or gray falls out, probably because the immune system attacks dark-hair bulbs. Thus, all that is left is the white or gray hair. Various experts I’ve consulted suggest that the phenomenon represents a bit of media hype—it is extremely rare and usually takes weeks or months, rather than occurring in a single night.</p>

    <p class="calibre23">A particularly amusing account of the history of the disorder and speculations about it can be found in Jelinek, J., “Sudden whitening of the hair,” <span><span class="italic">Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine</span></span> 48 (1972): 1003. Jelinek, a professor of dermatology, recounts many tales over the centuries of people who, condemned to be executed by their king, turn white with terror the night before the scheduled execution. The now white-haired prisoner is brought before the king and assembled court for execution the next morning. Everyone is moved with wonder and pity at the transformation, and the poor wretch is pardoned. Numerous sources claim that the hair and beard of Sir Thomas More, who had fallen out of favor with King Henry VIII and was condemned to death, turned white the day before his execution. In contrast to the general pattern of these tales, Henry, unimpressed, still had him killed and his head parboiled and displayed on London Bridge. Over the course of her imprisonment prior to her execution, Marie Antoinette’s hair was also reported to have turned gray. This may not have represented a true case of alopecia areata, however. “It has cynically been conjectured that the keepers of her dungeon neglected to furnish their guest’s dressing table with hair dyes. The iconoclast respects nothing, not even the grey hairs of royalty,” opined the mordant Dr. Jelinek.</p>

    <p class="calibre23">If you view the world in a certain myopic way, you might argue that alopecia areata plays the central role in making sense of modern life. For example, a number of media pundits commented on the noticable graying of Osama bin Laden’s hair from one clandestine video to the next, taking that as a sign of the stressful toll that the (unsuccessful) U.S. hunt for him was exacting. Meanwhile, part of the documentation of mistreatment of Northern Irish political prisoners includes their hair turning white (Conroy, J., <span><span class="italic">Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People</span></span> [New York: Knopf, 2000]). On the historical front, an injurious train wreck is credited with having turned Annie Oakley’s celebrated long brown hair white within a few days (www.ormiston.com), while a recent road rage lawsuit in Palo Alto, California, involved not only charges of damage to an SUV (the rageful perpetrator dinged the car’s door when he kicked it, after the woman driving the SUV nearly ran over the man and his family in a crosswalk), but additional costs for her subsequent stress-induced hair loss. Alas, for those hoping for alopecia areata to take its rightful dominant place in the American legal system, that part of the lawsuit didn’t fly (“Kicking professor cops a plea,” <span><span class="italic">Palo Alto Daily News</span></span> [17 December 2003]).</p>

One of the themes that comes through is encompassed in the quote by the psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor, Victor Frankl: “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing, the last of human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances,” Frankl, V, <span><span class="italic">Man’s Search for Meaning</span></span> (New York: Basic Books, 1985). To return to a theme emphasized at various points in the book, it is immensely impressive and moving if some people were able to withstand the hell of the Holocaust with an intact ability to choose their attitude. However, no one should ever preach to some victim about how they are expected to pull off such a miracle of coping.</p>
