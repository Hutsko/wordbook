Perhaps the rat is so wiped out after the uncontrollable shocks that it simply doesn’t have the energy to perform active avoidance coping tasks. This would shift the emphasis away from learned helplessness as a cognitive state (“there is nothing I can do about this”) or an anhedonic emotional state (“nothing feels pleasurable”) to one of psychomotor inhibition (“everything seems so exhausting that I’m just going to sit here”). Seligman and Maier strongly object to this interpretation and present data showing that rats with learned helplessness are not only as active as control rats but, more important, are also impaired in “passive avoidance tasks”—learning situations where the coping response involves remaining still, rather than actually <span><span class="italic">doing</span></span> something (in other words, situations where a little psychomotor retardation should <span><span class="italic">help</span></span>). Championing the psychomotor retardation view is another major figure in this field, Jay Weiss, who presents an equal amount of data showing that “helpless” rats perform normally on passive avoidance tasks, indicating that the helplessness is a motor phenomenon and not a cognitive or emotional one. This debate has been going on for decades and I sure don’t know how to resolve the conflicting views.</span></p>
