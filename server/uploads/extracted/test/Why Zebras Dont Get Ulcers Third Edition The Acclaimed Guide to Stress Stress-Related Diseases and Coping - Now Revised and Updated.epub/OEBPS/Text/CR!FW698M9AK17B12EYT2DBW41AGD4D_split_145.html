I once read some weird screed about how no one actually likes being tickled, that it is all about power and control on the part of the tickler, particularly when children are involved, and how the laughing isn’t really pleasurable but is reflexive, and the requesting to be tickled is some sign of their acquiescence to their subordinance and loving of their chains, and soon terms like “phallocentric” and “dead white male” and fake quotes from Chief Seattle were being bandied about. As a biologist, one of the first things you do when confronting a puzzle like this is to go for the Phylogenetic Precedent to gain insight into a human phenomenon—do other species do this? Because if other, closely related species do the same thing, that weakens arguments about how the whole phenomenon is embedded in human culture. I can report here that chimps love to be tickled. All those chimps who get trained in American Sign Language—one of the first words they master is “tickle” and one of the first sentences is “tickle me.” In college, I worked with one of those chimps. He’d do the “tickle me” sequence correctly, and you’d tickle him like mad—chimps curl up and cover their ribs and make this fast, soundless, breathy giggle when they’re being tickled. Stop, he sits up, catches his breath, mops his brow because of how it’s all just too much. Then he gets a gleamy look in his eye and it’s, “Tickle me,” all over again.</span></p>
