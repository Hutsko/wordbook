      <p class="calibre53">For years, in lectures, I’ve rhetorically compared disease patterns in humans with those of zebras, and when sitting down to write this book, it suddenly scared the willies out of me that I wasn’t sure about the business with zebras and ulcers. And then where would we be? What good is a book entitled something like <span><span class="italic">Why Do Zebras Get Ulcers Less Frequently Than We Do and for Some Fairly Different Reasons, Although It’s Complicated</span></span>? However, according to M. Fowler, <span><span class="italic">Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine</span></span>, 2d ed. (Philadelphia: Saunders, 1986) and phone calls to the zebra vets at the Brookfield, Bronx, National, Philadelphia, and San Diego zoos, ulcers are extremely uncommon in zebras. They occur in animals undergoing severe and unnatural stress (e.g., when they are first transported into a zoo), but that is about the only circumstance. Stated in the framework of this book, when left to their own devices (either in the wild or in reasonably large enclosures in a zoo), zebras don’t develop ulcers.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Many of the ideas in this chapter have a long history in stress physiology. The main point was stated well by Walter Cannon over half a century ago: “A highly important change has occurred in the incidence of disease in our country…serious infections, formerly extensive and disastrous, have markedly decreased or almost disappeared,…meanwhile, conditions involving strain in the nervous system have been greatly augmented” (“The role of emotion in disease,” <span><span class="italic">Annals of Internal Medicine</span></span> 9, no. 2 [May 1936]).</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Viewed through the eclipse of World War II, we seem to remember World War I with odd fondness—Irving Berlin tunes, colorful uniforms, rickety motorcars, and heads of states with silly titles and big mustaches. Eight and a half million people were killed in the pointless bloodbath we know as World War I (D. Fromkin, <span><span class="italic">A Peace to End All Peace</span></span> [New York: Avon Books, 1989], 379). The flu that swept the planet at the same time, by contrast, killed 20 million (W. McNeill, <span><span class="italic">Plagues and Peoples</span></span> [New York: Doubleday Books, 1976], 255). “The sum of American sailors and soldiers who died of flu and pneumonia in 1918 is over 43,000, about 80 percent of American battle deaths in the war” (A. Crosby, <span><span class="italic">Epidemic and Peace</span></span> [London: Greenwood Press, 1918, 1976], 36). Also: Kolata, G., <span><span class="italic">Flu</span></span> (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1999).</p>

      <p class="calibre53">The definitive study on chess players was carried out by the physiologist Leroy DuBeck and his graduate student Charlotte Leedy. They wired up chess players in order to measure their breathing rates, blood pressure, muscle contractions, and so on, and monitored the players before, during, and after major tournaments. They found tripling of breathing rates, muscle contractions, systolic blood pressures that soared to over 200—exactly the sort of thing seen in athletes during physical competition. See the original report, Leedy’s thesis, “The effects of tournament chess playing on selected physiological responses in players of varying aspirations and abilities” (Temple University, 1975) or their brief report (Leedy, C, and DuBeck, L., “Physiological changes during tournament chess,” <span><span class="italic">Chess Life and Review</span></span> [1971]: 708). In a telephone conversation, DuBeck also tells the story of the international match in the early 1970s between grand masters Bent Larson and Bobby Fischer, in which the former had to be given antihypertensive medication in the middle of his losing match; his blood pressure remained elevated for days afterward. The Kasparov-Karpov report is from the <span><span class="italic">New York Times</span></span>, 20 December 1990. And for that special chess fan out there who just can’t get enough of this subject, may I suggest as the perfect gift a copy of Glezerov, V., and Sobol, E., “Hygienic evaluation of the changes in work capacity of young chess players during training,” <span><span class="italic">Gigiena i Sanitariia</span></span> 24 (1987), in the original Russian.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Selye published numerous autobiographical articles and books, many of which contain the story of the ovarian extract and his discovery of the nonspecific stress-response; a good example is <span><span class="italic">The Stress of My Life</span></span> (New York: Van Nostrand, 1979). The book also contains Selye’s claim that he was the first to use the word <span><span class="italic">stress</span></span> in a biomedical, rather than an engineering, sense. Actually, Walter Cannon beat him to it by decades (“The interrelations of emotions as suggested by recent physiological researches,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Psychology</span></span> 25 [1914]: 256). This point was brought up in a colorful debate between Selye and John Mason, a psychiatrist whose pioneering work on the psychological stress-response is discussed later (Mason, J., “A historical view of the stress field,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Human Stress</span></span> 1, no. 6 [1975]: part II, 1, 22. Selye, H., “Confusion and controversy in the stress field,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Human Stress</span></span> 1 [1975]: 37).</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Descriptions of Addison’s disease can be found in all endocrinology textbooks, as it is one of the best-studied endocrine disorders.

      <div class="calibre6">
        &nbsp;

      <p class="calibre53">The D. H. Lawrence quotation is from <span><span class="italic">Lady Chatterley’s Lover</span></span> (Cutchogue, N. Y.: Buccaneer Books, 1983). The idea for this example comes from a colleague, the British immunologist Nick Hall. He regularly lectures to halls of distracted scientists clicking away with their three-color pens; he starts off with some really steamy passage of Lawrence recited in his impressive English accent, and rivets their attention.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">The testicular injection mania began in 1889, with a paper published by the formidable Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, entitled “On the physiological and therapeutic role of a juice extracted from the testicles of animals according to a number of facts observed in man,” <span><span class="italic">Archives de physiologie normale et pathologique</span></span>, 5e series (1889): 1, 739.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">A lot of the facts Brown-Sequard collected had been observed in one man, himself. Brown-Sequard was arguably the most august physiologist in the world at the time, age seventy-two and with somewhat declining energies. He had theorized that some features of senescence of humans were due to declining gonadal function (the more global statements about such decline as the cause of aging came from later followers). He felt that the testes contained some sort of active secreted substance, and he started injecting himself subcutaneously with extracts of testes from dogs and guinea pigs. He was absolutely right that the testes secreted a substance—testosterone (which had not yet been discovered; the term <span><span class="italic">hormone</span></span> did not even exist then)—but his experiment couldn’t possibly work, since he made his extracts in water; testosterone, because of its chemical nature, does not dissolve in water.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">Despite that, he reported wondrous results (increased physical vitality, increased length of his jet of urine—the latter no doubt being the sort of thing we all hope to retain into our golden years). All placebo. The reproductive physiologist Roger Gosden of Leeds University in the United Kingdom suspects that Brown-Sequard was probably depressed at the time of his experiments and thus was particularly vulnerable to such a placebo effect (see Page 148 in Gosden, R., <span><span class="italic">Cheating Time: Science, Sex and Ageing</span></span> [London: Macmillan, 1996]). Nevertheless, doctors were thrilled at the report, and within two years, organotherapy, as it was called, was being used worldwide. Brown-Sequard took particular umbrage at the charlatans making quick money using his (altogether incorrect and ineffectual) discovery, particularly the American hucksters soon selling “Dr. Brown-Sequard’s Elixir of Life.” He also expanded his theory a bit, noting that loss of semen resulted in loss of strength (twenty years earlier he had speculated on the rejuvenative effects of intravenous injections of sperm into men, an idea fortunately not tried), citing the well-known physical and mental weaknesses of men who masturbated frequently or who had frequent intercourse. (For the original citations and a thorough review of the subject, see Borell, M., “Brown-Sequard’s organotherapy and its appearance in America at the end of the nineteenth century,” <span><span class="italic">Bulletin of the History of Medicine</span></span> 50 [1976]: 309, as well as the very entertaining section on the subject in Gosden’s book.)</p>

      <p class="calibre53">The history of hypothalamic hormones (Harris’s theory that the brain was an endocrine organ, and the work of Guillemin and Schally) has been well documented, especially in the aftermath of the award of the Nobel Prize to the latter pair. This is because of the ferocity and colorfulness of the Guillemin-Schally race, and because the huge, “corporate” lab that each evolved in the process seemed the wave of the scientific future at the time. For a particularly readable account, see Wade, N., <span><span class="italic">The Nobel Duel: Two Scientists’ 21-Year Race to Win the World’s Most Coveted Research Prize</span></span> (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press, 1981). The quotation from Schally about the competition with Guillemin is in Wade’s book, page 7. For a dauntingly academic account of the sociology of Guillemin’s lab (although it is not identified as Guillemin’s by name), see Latour, B., and Woolgar, S., <span><span class="italic">Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Scientific Facts</span></span> (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage Publications, 1979).</p>

      <p class="calibre23">New releasing and inhibiting factors continue to be isolated, still often in sprints to the finish line by research groups in frenzied competition with one another. An exception to this pattern came in 1981 with the isolation of what was perhaps the most sought-after of the brain hormones. This hormone, which will be discussed throughout the book, is the main way in which the brain controls a principal branch of the stress-response. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), as it is called, was the first brain hormone whose existence was inferred (in 1955) but one of the last ones isolated, because it turned out to be among the most chemically complex. In a wrinkle on the old Guillemin-Schally dichotomy, its isolation was carried out by a team headed by Wylie Vale, once Guillemin’s right-hand man. Vale and his band of renegades, in a lab of their own, had the audacity to look for CRH in places none of the other researchers had tried in the twenty-five years of investigation, by considering very unlikely chemical structures for CRF. One turned out to be the right one, and they beat the competition by miles. See Vale, W., Speiss, J., Rivier, C., and Rivier, J., “Characterization of a 41-residue ovine hypothalamic peptide that stimulates the secretions of corticotropin and beta-endorphin,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 213 (1983): 1394.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Good general overviews of what the cardiovascular system does during stress can be found in most physiology textbooks, although the information is rarely explicitly organized under the topic of “stress.” Instead, it can usually be found in a chapter on the heart itself, or on the physiological response to exercise. Those reviews typically focus on the role of the sympathetic nervous system in regulating the cardiovascular system.

Cardiologists are beginning to get some sense of what causes this paradoxical vasoconstriction. In healthy tissue, when the heart starts working hard, hormones called EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxant factors) and prostacyclin are secreted, causing the vasodilation. When cardiac tissue is made ischemic on a regular basis, it loses the capacity to release EDRF and prostacyclin for some reason. In addition, hormones called endothelin and serotonin, which cause vasoconstriction, seem to be released. As a result, epinephrine and norepinephrine now cause constriction instead of dilation. Interestingly, this paradoxical vasoconstriction is also observed in the socially stressed monkeys, discussed above, who developed atherosclerosis. One way to dilate coronary arteries during angina pectoris is to take a synthetic version of EDRF—nitroglycerin. For epidemiological evidence that stress is more likely to worsen preexisting heart disease than to cause it outright, see Greenwood, D., Muir, K., Packham, C., and Madeley, R., “Coronary heart disease: a review of the role of psychosocial stress and social support,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Public Health Medicine</span></span> 18 (1996): 221.

Curt Richter, by contrast, didn’t gather any firsthand accounts of his own. Instead, he noted the similarity between the accounts in Cannon’s paper and cases of parasympathetic-induced death in rats undergoing severe stressors in his own laboratory (he noted that the phenomenon occurred much more readily in wild rats captured and brought to his lab than in the lab-bred strains, and made comparisons between “uncivilized primitive humans” and undomesticated wild rats).

      <p class="calibre23">As he described in <span><span class="italic">The Serpent and the Rainbow</span></span> (New York: Warner Books, 1985), Wade Davis believed he had isolated the critical substance—a poison called tetrodotoxin, isolated from puffer fish—that the Haitian witch doctors use to put someone in a zombified state. This is the same poison found in the fugu fish, used in Japanese cooking. (When the fugu chef leaves a smidgen of the tetrodotoxin gland in the fish, the well-paying customer gets a mild buzz. When the chef leaves too much in, the well-paying customer goes into a coma. Fugu chefs, by the way, are carefully licensed.) Davis made a fascinating argument that zombification in Haiti reflected the intersection of the biology of tetrodotoxin action and the anthropology of traditional Haitian religion: when a Japanese businessman gets major tetrodotoxin poisoning and recovers, he sues the chef and switches restaurants. When a Haitian villager gets the same tetrodotoxin poisoning and recovers, he realizes that his village hired a shaman to poison him because he has done something terrible—he awakes as an ostracized zombie with no will, and then is often used for slave labor (although in some cases, the zombified person’s passive state is promoted by continually drugging him). It’s a charming story, although the isolation of tetrodotoxin remains controversial. Davis and tetrodotoxin zombification became so trendy in the 1980s that in Garry Trudeau’s <span><span class="italic">Doonesbury</span></span>, Uncle Duke was zombified at one point, and <span><span class="italic">Miami Vice</span></span> used the zombie motif in an episode about drug runners from Haiti.</p>

The introductory reference given above will teach the general principle that it is inefficient to repeatedly store away energy and then reverse the process by mobilizing it. However, in order to gain a detailed, quantitative understanding of it, one must become something of an accountant—learning what the currency of energy is in the body and how much it costs to make all those deposits and withdrawals in the body’s metabolic banks. For this, one must consult biochemistry texts (typically, of the early graduate school level of difficulty); among the best is Stryer, L., <span><span class="italic">Biochemistry</span></span>, 4th ed.

      <p class="calibre53">One of the puzzles of how diabetes affects your health has been solved. It is relatively easy to understand how extra glucose in the bloodstream can clog blood vessels and cause damage. One of the mysteries, however, is why high levels of circulating glucose damage the eye (diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in this country). It turns out that glucose can stick to all sorts of proteins, causing them to form aggregates; indeed, because of its structure, glucose can stick onto proteins without the aid of enzymes to mediate the process, something called nonenzymatic modification. Once glucose fuses these proteins, they have to be broken apart and replaced. However, in some tissues—such as the lens of the eye—proteins are not recycled very frequently, and those cells are stuck with the fused mess. For a discussion of the nonenzymatic chemistry of sugars, focusing on its implications for aging and adult-onset diabetes, see Lee, A., and Cerami, A., “Modifications of proteins and nucleic acids by reducing sugars: possible role in aging,” in Schneider, E., and Rowe, J., eds., <span><span class="italic">Handbook of the Biology of Aging</span></span>, 3d ed.

      <p class="calibre23">The low rates of insulin-resistant diabetes in nonwesternized populations pose a fascinating mystery. If these people begin eating westernized diets, they get astonishingly high rates of insulin-resistant diabetes. Part of this has an obvious explanation; once these various groups gain entrée into our world of packaged food and processed sugars, they tend to eat themselves into obesity (and, thus, high rates of this diabetes). However, the mystery is that given the same diet and degree of obesity, most people in the developing world are at greater risk for such diabetes than people in Western societies. Diabetes rates soar among Mexicans and Japanese after they emigrate to the United States, among Asian Indians moving to Britain, and among Yemenite Jews moving to Israel. In the most striking cases, about half the adult residents of the Pacific island of Nauru have diabetes (fifteen times the rate in the United States), while more than 70 percent of the Pima people of Arizona over age fifty-five have diabetes. In the absence of a Western diet, there is virtually no diabetes—as a striking correlate of this, Pima in Arizona weigh an average of 60 pounds more than Pima living in Mexico, with a more traditional diet.

      <p class="calibre23">Why should those in the developing world be at such risk for diabetes once they start consuming a Western diet? One fascinating theory is that the gene for a propensity to diabetes is adaptive in nonwesternized settings. Normally, westerners are inefficient at handling dietary sugar; not all of it is absorbed from the circulation, getting lost in the urine. The notion is that people of the developing world are more efficient at utilizing sugar; the second they get any in their circulation, they have a burst of insulin secretion and every bit of the sugar gets stored, instead of urinated away. This makes sense, given tough environments with intermittent food sources, where every little bit must be exploited. And it is easy to imagine this as a genetic trait—for example, genes might alter the sensitivity with which the pancreas senses circulating glucose concentrations and releases insulin, or the sensitivity with which target tissues respond to insulin. These have been termed “thrifty genes,” and at least one such candidate in fat cells has been found to have a mutation among Pima Indians. Reviewed in Ezzell, C., “Fat times for obesity research,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of NIH Research 7</span></span>, no. 10 (1995): 39. Another has been related to cholesterol transport in populations in northern India (Holden, C., “Race and medicine,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 302 [2003]: 594.)</p>

      <p class="calibre23">With traditional diets in the developing world, this trigger-happy insulin secretion keeps the body from wasting any sugar. Once people begin eating a westernized, high-sugar diet, this tendency leads to constant bursts of insulin secretion, which is more likely to cause storage tissues to become insulin resistant, leading to insulin-resistant diabetes. People in Western countries, in contrast, are theorized to have more sluggish insulin responses to sugar; the net result is less efficient storing of sugar from the circulation, but lower risk of diabetes. And why are people in westernized societies theorized to be genetically less efficient in handling blood sugar? Because a few centuries back, as we first began eating typical westernized diets, those people with the greatest tendency toward insulin secretion failed to survive and pass on their genes. This predicts that populations like the Nauru islanders and Pima are undergoing the same process now; in a few centuries, most of their descendants will be the offspring of the rare individuals now with the lower diabetes risk. In support of this prediction, the rate of diabetes is already beginning to decline among the Nauru islanders.

      <p class="calibre23">But at present the existence of thrifty genes, and their differential presence in different human populations, is mostly speculative.

      <p class="calibre53">Stress-related ulcers are predominantly formed during the poststress recovery period, rather than during the stressor itself: Overmier, J., Murison, R., and Ursin, H., “The ulcerogenic effect of a rest period after exposure to water-restraint stress,” <span><span class="italic">Behavioral and Neural Biology</span></span> 46 (1986): 372; Vincent, G., and Pare, W., “Post stress development and healing of supine-restraint induced stomach lesions in the rat,” <span><span class="italic">Physiology and Behavior</span></span> 29 (1982): 721; Desiderato, O., MacKinnon, J., and Hissom, H., “Development of gastric ulcers in rats following stress termination,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology</span></span> 87 (1974): 208; Glavin, G., “Restraint ulcer: history, current research and future implications,” <span><span class="italic">Brain Research Bulletin</span></span> 5 (1980): supp. 1, 51.

      <p class="calibre23">Back to hydrochloric acid digesting the stomach in which it is secreted: if the mucous layer prevents the acid from penetrating it, how can acid, first secreted by the stomach wall, ever get through the mucous layer to digest food? This conundrum is answered by Bhaskar, K., Garik, P., Turner, B., Bradley, J., Bansil, R., Stanley, H., and Lamont, J., “Viscous fingering of hydrochloric acid through gastric mucin,” <span><span class="italic">Nature</span></span> 360 (1992): 458.</p>

Bicarbonate secretion decreases with sustained stress in an animal ulcer model: Takeuchi, K., Furukawa, O., and Okabe, S., “Induction of duodenal ulcers in rats under water-immersion stress conditions: influence on gastric acid and duodenal alkaline secretion,” <span><span class="italic">Gastroenterology</span></span> 91 (1986): 554. Mucus secretion decreases with stress and with glucocorticoid administration: Schuster, M., “Irritable bowel syndrome,” in Sleisenger, M., and Fordtron, J., eds., <span><span class="italic">Gastrointestinal Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Management</span></span>, 4th ed. (Philadelphia: Saunders, 1989), 1402. In approximately half the cases, during this rebound period the amount of gastric acid secreted is normal, implying that the problem is that the stomach wall is relatively more vulnerable, since the acidic attack is not stronger than usual: Dayal, Y., and DeLellis, R., “The gastrointestinal tract,” in Robbins, S., Cotran, R., and Kumar, V., eds., <span><span class="italic">Pathologic Basis of Disease</span></span>, 4th ed. (Philadelphia: Saunders, 1989), 827; also Weiner, H., “From simplicity to complexity (1950–1990): the case of peptic ulceration—I.

      <p class="calibre23">As noted, an interesting implication of the rebound phenomenon is that in a person at risk for a stress ulcer, continuous stress may protect against the formation of an ulcer (although, as noted, this is not a good prescriptive idea for many other reasons). As a building block of that idea, sustained administration of CRH will protect against ulcer formation: Murison, R., and Bakke, H., “The role of corticotropin-releasing factor in rat gastric ulcerogenesis,” in Hernandez, D., and Glavin, G., eds., <span><span class="italic">Neurobiology of Stress Ulcers</span></span> (New York: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1990), vol. 597, 71.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Ulcers form as a result of decreased blood flow to the stomach, causing ischemic lesions, due to both acid accumulation and to formation of oxygen radicals. These ideas are reviewed in Tsuda, A., and Tanaka, M., “Neurochemical characteristics of rats exposed to activity stress,” in Hernandez, D., and Glavin, G., eds., <span><span class="italic">Neurobiology of Stress Ulcers</span></span>, op. cit., vol. 597, 146; also Yabana, T., and Yachi, A., “Stress-induced vascular damage and ulcer,” <span><span class="italic">Digestive Disease Science</span></span> 33 (1988): 751; also Menguy, R., “The prophylaxis of stress ulceration,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 302 (1980): 461; also Robert, A., and Kauffman, G., “Stress ulcers, erosions and gastric motility injury,” in Sleisenger, M., and Fordtron, J., eds., <span><span class="italic">Gastrointestinal Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Management</span></span>, 4th ed.

      <p class="calibre53">Although glucocorticoids may cause ulcer formation by suppressing the immune system during stress via this route, it is not clear how important this is for mild stressors. During mild or infrequent stressors, the levels of glucocorticoids secreted do not predict whether ulcers form: Murison, R., and Overmeir, J., “Adrenocortical activity and disease, with reference to gastric pathology in animals,” in Hellhammer, D., Florin, I., and Weiner, H., eds., <span><span class="italic">Neurobiological Approaches to Human Disease</span></span> (Toronto: Hans Huber, 1988), 335. Moreover, removal of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomizing a rat actually protects against ulcers: Brodie, D., “Experimental peptic ulcer,” <span><span class="italic">Gastroenterology</span></span> 55 (1968): 125.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">All this suggests that glucocorticoids are unlikely to be the cause of ulcers during stress. However, with more sustained or repeated stressors, the amount of glucocorticoids secreted does predict the severity of ulceration: Weiss, J., “Somatic effects of predictable and unpredictable shock,” <span><span class="italic">Psychosomatic Medicine</span></span> 32 (1980): 397; Weiss, J., “Effects of coping behavior in different warning signal conditions on stress pathology in rats,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology</span></span> 77 (1981): 1; Murphy, H., Wideman, C., and Brown, T., “Plasma corticosterone levels and ulcer formation in rats with hippocampal lesions,” <span><span class="italic">Neuroendocrinology</span></span> 28 (1979): 123. In addition, supraphysiological levels of glucocorticoids (levels that are higher in the bloodstream than the body can normally generate, even during stress, but are induced by taking glucocorticoid medication) can cause ulcers: Robert, A., and Nezmis, J., “Histopathology of steroid-induced ulcers: an experimental study in the rat,” <span><span class="italic">Archives of Pathology</span></span> 77 (1964): 407.</p>

In one remarkable passage that encapsulated both his Oedipal wooing of her and his pathological identification with her, he predicted that in his later years, “when age must dim my mind and the past comes sweeping back like the shades of night over the bare road of the present, it will not, I believe, be my youth I shall see but hers, not a boy clinging to his mother’s skirt and crying, ‘Wait till I’m a man, and you’ll lie on feathers,’ but a little girl in a magenta frock and a white pinafore.” He also had a lifelong obsession with young boys, and his private writing includes passages of sadomasochism and pedophilia.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">What is perhaps most fascinating is the transition of Barrie from a rather pathetic and sympathetic loner as a young man to a far-from-sympathetic manipulator in his later years, all because his writing success brought him the power and wealth to disrupt lives around him. As he grew older, alone and childless, he inveigled his way into the lives of a succession of young couples, appearing as a generous benefactor and gradually coming to dominate them more and more, especially the fates of the sons in these families (one boy, Peter Davies, became the model for Peter Pan; he loathed the association all his adult life and, probably unrelated to that, threw himself in front of a London subway at age sixty-three). For the most interesting of the Barrie biographies (from which the above quotation was taken), I recommend Birkin, A., <span><span class="italic">J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys</span></span> (London: Constable, 1979).

      <p class="calibre23">The estimate of $1 billion in savings is based on the following (admittedly very crude) analysis. A federal report in 1987 (“Neonatal Intensive Care for Low Birthweight Infants: Costs and Effectiveness,” Health Technology Case Study 38, Office of Technology Assessment, Washington, D.C.) reported 150,000–200,000 infants admitted annually to neonatal intensive care units, of whom approximately 20 percent were of very low weight (less than 3 pounds). The average length of stay for that most vulnerable group was approximately 48 days at a cost of $41,000; for the other 80 percent, average stay was approximately 28 days at a cost of $24,000. Total hospitalization bills thus come to something in excess of $5 billion, based on an average individual stay of approximately 32 days (weighting the two different groups). Thus an average reduction of one week’s stay in the intensive care unit constitutes an approximate 20 percent reduction and (assuming, probably incorrectly, that the rate of expense incurred is constant over time) produces savings something in excess of a billion dollars. This does not even count savings on the considerable costs of outpatient care lasting months to years for preemies after discharge (discussed in Blackman, J., “Neonatal intensive care: is it worth it?” <span><span class="italic">Pediatric Clinics of North America</span></span>, 38, no. 6 [1991]).</p>

      <p class="calibre23">A recent paper reports a fascinating example of the reproductive suppression caused by a combination of physical and psychological stressors in a population of wild animals. A population of male elephants in a national park in Africa were orphaned by poachers, and as a result, grew up without role models. When, as adolescents, they came into heat (called “musth” in male elephants), they turned into elephant hoodlums—hyperaggressive, hypersexual (if I recall correctly, trying to forcibly mate with anything of an appropriate size, including the rhinos). Adult males were introduced into the study to stress and harass these rogue males out of musth: Slotow, R., Van Dyk, G., Poole, J., Page, B., Klocke, A., “Older bull elephants control young males,” <span><span class="italic">Nature</span></span> 408 (2000): 425.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">Similarly, major amounts of exercise suppress reproductive physiology in women. As one example, highly active ballet dancers have their onset of puberty delayed: Warren, M., “The effects of exercise on pubertal progression and reproductive function in girls,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</span></span> 51 (1980): 1150; Frisch, R., Wyshak, G., and Vincent, L., “Delayed menarche and amenorrhea in ballet dancers,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 303 (1980): 17; Bale, P., Doust, J., and Dawson, D., “Gymnasts, distance runners, anorexics: body composition and menstrual status,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness</span></span>, 36 (1996): 49.

In these cases, the degree of dysfunction is tightly coupled with body weight or body fat content: Sanborn, C., Martin, B., and Wagner, W., “Is athletic amenorrhea specific to runners?” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</span></span> 143 (1982): 859; Shangold, M., and Levine, H., “The effect of marathon training upon menstrual function,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</span></span> 143 (1982): 862.

      <p class="calibre23">Some of the additional effects of overexercising. A moderate amount of exercise will increase bone density, particularly in the bones most heavily utilized in the exercise: Nilsson, B., and Westlin, N., “Bone density in athletes,” <span><span class="italic">Clinical Orthopedics</span></span> 77 (1971): 179; Lanyon, L., “Bone loading, exercise, and the control of bone mass; the physiological basis for the prevention of osteoporosis,” <span><span class="italic">Bone</span></span> 6 (1989): 19. Nevertheless, extremes of exercise can reverse this trend, leading to bone thinning, increased risk of osteoporosis, scoliosis, and stress fractures: Myburgh, K., Hutchins, J., Fataar, A., Hough, S., and Koakes, T., “Low bone density is an etiologic factor for stress fractures in athletes,” <span><span class="italic">Annals of Internal Medicine</span></span> 113 (1990): 754; Drinkwater, B., Nilson, K., and Chesnut, C., “Bone mineral content of amoenorrheic and eumenorrheic athletes,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 311 (1984): 277; Marcus, R., Cann, C., Madvig, P., Minkoff, J., Goddard, M., Bayer, M., Martin, M., Gaudiani, L., Haskell, W., and Genant, H., “Menstrual function and bone mass in elite women distance runners: endocrine and metabolic factors,” <span><span class="italic">Annals of Internal Medicine</span></span> 102 (1985): 158; Barrow, G., and Saha, S., “Menstrual irregularity and stress fractures in collegiate female distance runners,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Sports Medicine</span></span> 16 (1988): 209. The same occurs in male athletes: Bennell, K., Brukner, P., and Malcolm, S., “Effect of altered reproductive function and lowered testosterone levels on bone density in male endurance athletes,” <span><span class="italic">British Journal of Sports Medicine</span></span> 30 (1996): 205. In prepubescent female athletes, the risks also include scoliosis: Warren, M., Brooks-Gunn, J., Hamilton, J., Warren, L., and Hamilton, G., “Scoliosis and fractures in young ballet dancers: relation to delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 314 (1986): 1348.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">These deleterious effects may be due, in part, to the elevated levels of glucocorticoids seen in serious athletes: Luger, A., Deuster, P., Kyle, S., Gallucci, W., Montgomery, L., Gold, P., Loriaux, L., and Chrousos, G., “Acute hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to the stress of treadmill exercise,” <span><span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span></span> 316 (1987): 1309; Willaneuva, A., Schlosser, C., Hopper, B., Liu, J., Hoffman, D., and Rebar, R., “Increased cortisol production in women runners,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</span></span> 63 (1986): 133; Loucks, A., Mortola, J., Girton, L., and Yen, S., “Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes in athletic women,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</span></span> 68 (1989): 402.

Just to make life and sex more complicated, researchers are coming to recognize that there are mechanisms for inducing erections that do not involve the parasympathetic nervous system. These are poorly understood, but it appears that these nerve endings make the arteries into the penis dilate (and thus engorge the penis with blood) by way of nitric oxide, a newly identified gaseous neurotransmitter that is closely related to nitrous oxide (laughing gas): Ignarro, L., “Nitric oxide as the physiological mediator of penile erection,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of NIH Research</span></span> 4 (1992): 59.</p>

      <p class="calibre53">Incidences of psychogenic impotency: it remains controversial just how common this disorder is.

These numbers are almost certainly high, as they come from a time when many subtle organic causes of impotency were not yet understood. Some more recent studies report extremely low rates (perhaps 10 to 15 percent) of psychogenic impotency. For example, see Spark, R., White, R., and Connolly, P., “Impotence is not always psychogenic,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association</span></span> 243 (1980): 750. In general, recent studies indicate rates ranging from 14 percent of cases of impotency being psychogenic in nature to one study showing that 55 percent were, with another 15 percent being of unknown origin.

      <p class="calibre53">For an introduction to revisionist ecology about hyenas (their role as hunters, rather than just scavengers) see Kruuk, H., <span><span class="italic">The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior</span></span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972). For studies of their anatomy, physiology, and behavior, see Frank, L., “Social organization of the spotted hyena: II. Dominance and reproduction,” <span><span class="italic">Animal Behavior</span></span> 35 (1986): 1510; Frank, L., Glickman, S., and Licht, P., “Fatal sibling aggression, presocial development and androgens in neonatal spotted hyenas,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 252 (1991): 702; Frank, L., “The evolution of female masculinization in hyenas: why does a female hyena have such a large penis?” <span><span class="italic">Trends in Ecology and Evolution</span></span> 12 (1997): 58.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">The final reference discusses the possible evolution of the unique hyena anatomy and social system. The most plausible scenario revolves around the fact that most large carnivores in Africa, such as lions, have large litters; relatively few of the offspring survive. Most starve to death, and this is because a lioness and her cubs are usually excluded from feeding on a kill until the males are sated (despite that the females do the bulk of the hunting—there, one less feature to admire lions for).</p>

      <p class="calibre23">By contrast, hyenas tend to have fewer progeny than these other carnivores. Suddenly the pressure is on to get those few to survive. Somewhere back when, a female hyena had a wondrous mutation—her ovaries started secreting huge amounts of the male sex hormone androstenedione, in addition to the normal estrogen. As a result, when she was pregnant, her female fetuses were exposed to the hormone, and as a result, they grew up more muscular and aggressive than typical female mammals; and the tables got turned. Within a few generations, the starving, intimidated male hyenas go and kill something, and just as they are about to gorge, the females boot them off. The kids of high-ranking moms eat before any adult males do; they survive. Thus the tendency in females toward secreting large amounts of androstenedione is highly adaptive, likely to be passed on over the generations.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">There is one problem with this, however. Your average female mammal, exposed to those sorts of male sex hormone levels at birth, won’t be having kids. The androstenedione would have “masculinized” her hypothalamus, which is to say that, as an adult, her hypothalamus would secrete LHRH at a roughly constant rate (as males do) instead of in the cyclic pattern that females need to ovulate. In any other species, this “perinatal androgenization” (masculinization around the time of birth) would make it impossible to reproduce.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">Therefore, female hyenas are speculated to have a second mutation, one that protects the reproductive part of the hypothalamus from the masculinizing effects of the hormones. (By contrast, the “aggressive” part of the brain—a phrase that is obviously simplistic—is plenty sensitive to the androstenedione: the female hyenas are terrifyingly aggressive.) At present, no one has a clue what that second mutation may be.</p>

      <p class="calibre23">These reviews also give a good introduction to the reproductive abnormalities seen in anorexia nervosa. Anorexia and the related eating disorder bulimia are peculiar in that more is going on than just loss of weight. Specifically, reproductive suppression occurs even before there is substantial weight loss; in other words, the reproductive systems of anorexics and bulimics are more vulnerable to such suppression than those of healthy women and girls. For a recent finding linking metabolism and female fertility, see: Burks, D., de Mora, J., Schubert, M., Withers, D., Myers, M., Towery, H., Altamuro, S., Flint, C., White, M., “IRS-2 pathways integrate female reproduction and energy homeostasis,” <span><span class="italic">Nature</span></span> 407 (2000): 377.</p>

(GnRH, LHRH, and LHRF all refer to the same hypothalamic hormone, which causes release of LH and FSH from the pituitary.)

This study examined an amenorrheic runner with low LH levels; when she was given a drug (naloxone) that blocked the action of beta-endorphin, LH levels rose. See the above male section for additional references regarding disrupted reproductive physiology in female athletes. An additional neurotransmitter seems to be implicated in stress-induced suppression of LHRH release: Akema, T., Chiba, A., Shinozaki, R., Oshida, M., Kimura, F., and Toyoda, J., “Acute stress suppresses the N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced LH release in the ovariectomized estrogen-primed rat,” <span><span class="italic">Neuroendocrinology</span></span> 62 (1995): 270.

      <p class="calibre23">Effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system: the most up-to-date and masterly of reviews can be found in McEwen, B., Biron, C., Brunson, K., Bulloch, K., Chambers, W., Dhabhar, F., Goldfarb, R., Kitson, R., Miller, A., Spencer, R., and Weiss, J., “The role of adrenocorticoids as modulators of immune function in health and disease: neural, endocrine and immune interactions,” <span><span class="italic">Brain Research Reviews</span></span> 23 (1997): 79.

      <p class="calibre23">Glucocorticoids kill cells of the immune system in many species and do so by causing the DNA to be chopped into small pieces. This has been shown in many studies; some of the classic ones are Wyllie, A., “Glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis is associated with endogenous endonuclease activation,” <span><span class="italic">Nature</span></span> 284 (1980): 555; Cohen, J., and Duke, R., “Glucocorticoid activation of a calcium-dependent endonuclease in thymocyte nuclei leads to cell death,” <span><span class="italic">Journal of Immunology</span></span> 132 (1984): 38; Compton, M., and Cidlowski, J., “Rapid in vivo effects of glucocorticoids on the integrity of rat lymphocyte genomic DNA,” <span><span class="italic">Endocrinology</span></span> 118 (1986): 38. As noted throughout the chapter, a frequent question runs along the line of “Okay, so if you inject an animal with a ton of glucocorticoids and you mess up its immune system in some way (in this case, by killing lymphocytes), is that a ‘physiological’ effect—will the smaller amounts of glucocorticoids secreted during stress (or stress itself) do the same thing?” The previous paper also presents a small amount of data suggesting that stress will damage lymphocytes in the same way: Compton, M., Haskill, J., and Cidlowski, J., “Analysis of glucocorticoid actions on rat thymocyte DNA by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry,” <span><span class="italic">Endocrinology</span></span> 122 (1988): 2158.

      <p class="calibre53">The idea that not all the traits of an organism are necessarily sculpted by evolution to be adaptive runs through much of Stephen Jay Gould’s writing.

Footnote: Just to make things worse, the same issue contained a report that IL-1 works at the level of the pituitary, rather than the hypothalamus in the brain, to stimulate the stress-response: Bernton, E., Beach, J., Holaday, J., Smallridge, R., and Fein, H., “Release of multiple hormones by a direct action of Interleukin-1 on pituitary cells,” <span><span class="italic">Science</span></span> 238 (1987): 519. I think a vague consensus is emerging in the field that the effect on the hypothalamus occurs reproducibly in an animal, whereas the pituitary effect depends on the use of pituitary cells in a petri dish (rather than in the living animal) and on the conditions under which the cells are grown in the dish. For recent advances in this area, see: Bethin, K. E., Vogt, S. K., Muglia, L.

This business of trying to find links between lifestyle or personality and some disease outcome years later is extremely tricky. For example, it was widely reported that cancer rates went up in the surrounding areas following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979. However, it involved all types of cancers, including those not thought to be sensitive to the radiation released. In that case, the subtle confound was probably that people were more anxious and thus more vigilant, taking more trips to the doctors, who, aware of the accident history, checked things more carefully—and thus spotted more cancer.

[The handicapped] falsely assume that the lottery of life has penalized them at random. This is not so. ‘Nothing comes to an individual that he has not [at some point in his development] summoned.’” (Second set of brackets her own.) She extended this philosophy to explaining why James Brady, Reagan’s press secretary, had been seriously wounded in John Hinckley’s assassination attempt. Her policy advice included terminating any special educational programs for the handicapped. Fortunately, she lasted three days in her new position before being returned to the conservative fundamentalist think tank from which she had emerged.</p>

In the Senate, Gardner expressed her view that sometimes congenital illnesses are visited upon newborn infants not so much on account of their own sinfulness as because of the sinfulness of the parents—all the while apparently unaware that the senator presiding over her hearings, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, is the father of a congenitally retarded, institutionalized child and a passionate supporter of research into retardation and congenital abnormalities. Weicker, a veteran politician who probably is as knowledgeable as anyone can be about the corridors of power, described her testimony as “the most incredible thing I have read in my career in the United States Senate.

      <p class="calibre53">The history of status thymicolymphaticus was originally published by me under the title “Poverty’s remains,” <span><span class="italic">The Sciences</span></span> (September–October 1991): 8. The original observation of “enlarged” thymuses in SIDS infants was reported in 1830 by Kopp, J., “Denkwurdigkeiten in der artzlichen Praxis,” and was greatly expanded in 1889 by Paltauf, A., <span><span class="italic">Plotzlicher Thymus Tod</span></span>, Wiener klin. Woechesucher, Berlin 46 and 9. The supposed disease was named a few years later in Escherich, T., <span><span class="italic">Status thymico-lymphaticus</span></span>, Berlin klin. Woechesucher 29 (1896). By the late 1920s it was in all the textbooks, complete with radiation advice (how much to administer, where to aim it, and so on). See, for example, Lucas, W., <span><span class="italic">Modern Practise of Pediatrics</span></span> (New York: Macmillan, 1927). Amid this generally grim story, I was amused to note that by the time of this textbook, the “disease” was so well established that the author now broke ground by describing the distinctive and striking behavioral features of infants who would later be found to have died of thymicolymphaticus. They were characterized as having “phlegmatic” dispositions—presumably because these were normal kids and thus were phlegmatic about their imaginary illnesses. It is a chilling experience to wander the dusty lower floor of a medical library, reading these forgotten texts and their confident discussions of this supposed disease. Page after page of errors. What similar mistakes are we making now?</p>

      <p class="calibre23">Lost amid this consensus of the savants was a 1927 study by E. Boyd (“Growth of the thymus, its relation to status thymicolymphaticus and thymic symptoms,” <span><span class="italic">American Journal of Diseases of Children</span></span> 33 [1927]: 867), which should have put the whole thing to rest. Boyd showed for the first time that a stressor (malnutrition, in this case) caused thymic shrinking. She demonstrated, moreover, that some children who died of accidents turned out, upon autopsy, to be “suffering” from thymicolymphaticus, and suggested for the first time that the whole thing might be an artifact. It was not until the 1930s that the first of the pediatric textbooks began to voice the opinion that this conclusion might be correct; not until 1945 did the leading textbook in the field emphatically state that treating this “disease” was a disastrous thing to do (Nelson, W., <span><span class="italic">Nelson’s Textbook of Pediatrics</span></span>, 4th ed. [Philadelphia: Saunders, 1945]). In researching this subject, I had the pleasure of talking with the same Dr. Nelson, now in his nineties, still seeing inner-city children at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital every day and basking in the positive reviews of the recent edition of his classic textbook. He recalled how, by the early 1930s, the Young Turk pediatricians (one of whom he most surely was) were already contemptuous of the old guard for advocating something as crazy and outdated as radiating kids to prevent an imaginary disease. Despite that, the practice continued widely well into the 1950s.</p>
